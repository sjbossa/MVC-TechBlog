# MVC Tech Blog Website

Challenged to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers posts. Site was to be built completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku once completed. The application should follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
